    <h2><span style="color:rgb(18, 98, 156)">Project: How important is education?</span> </b></h2>
</div>

    <p>My project aims to investigates the importance of education and the impacts it has on society. This project looks at different levels of education,
      and its effects on income, employment, happiness and democracy.
    </p>

    <p>Firstly, It must be addressed that levels of education differ significantly around the world. I created three maps to show the disparities in 
      attendance/completion of primary, secondary and tertiary education globally. The darker areas of each map show a higher proportion of the population that 
      have either attended or are attending the different levels of education.

    <p> I obtained data for each of the three levels of education, and originally wanted to create one map with a selector
      where the reader could chooose which level to view, insead of seeing three seperate maps. However, this proved to be
      too difficult as the three sets of data were not similar enough, and my Vega kept crashing when I tried to do this.
      Instead, I decided to create three smaller maps and this worked out to be the better format, as it makes it easier for the 
      viewer to take in all the information and draw comparisons.

    <h2><span style="color:rgb(18, 98, 156)">Impact on earnings:</span></h2>

    <p> Clearly, education is not equal around the world, and this could be a reason why quality of life and so many other
      factors are also unequal. A huge reason for inequality is difference in income, so I decided to look at education's
      impact on that and see how much of the inequality education can explain. Firstly, insteas of diving straight into salaries,
      I wanted to see how education effects the likelihood of getting a job in the first place.

</div>

<p> The line chart shows huge gaps between the employment rates across all the OECD countries between citizens with a degree vs without 
  one. Clearly, extending education past secondary school is a beneficial way to decrease unemploymet. Furthermore, I then 
  moved on to looking at the salaries earned.
  This bar chart shows the difference in average incomes in the US over the past 10 years, between people who have obtained a university
  degree versus just completing secondary school.

    <p>This chart shows the clear increase in average income as an individual obtains a bachelor's degree. Over the period of
    2012-2021, the income for those with a degree is consistently about two times that of people with no degree. This amount
    clearly shows that the difference between just obtaining a high school diploma and a bachelor degree has a huge impact on average
    earnings. The graph also shows that the gap has widened over recent years, with salaries for those with a degree increasing at a faster
    rate than for those without one.</p>

    <h2><span style="color:rgb(18, 98, 156)">Impact on wellbeing:</span></h2>
  
    <p>Not only does education have an impact on the money side of life, but it also has strong links with happiness and quality of life.
      I decided to look at three indicators when thinking about wellbeing. Firstly, I know that citizens in democratic countries
      tend to have a better way of life, since there is more freedom and people are more in control. I thought there must be a 
      relationship between education and democracy, since in general when people learn about political systems and study history,
      democracy stands out as a superior system.

  </div>
  <p> This regression shows the change in democratic scores and compulsory years of education over the past 20 or so years, we can
    see that as compulsory years of schooling have risen around the world, so has the democratic scores. In particular as years progress, the relationship
    has got stronger, and the R2 score has nearly doubled. Therefore, stricter education laws and further encouragement of 
    schooling may improve the quality of life in dictatorship countries. I had some probelsm with my dataset, which is outlined in 
    my Colab notebook linked.
    Next I wanted to look at the correlation between the happiness index and having a bachelor's degree:

        </div>

    <p> This regression is clearly much more significant than the previous one, with there being a very strong positive
      relationship between the proportion of the population with a degree and the country's overall happiness score. 
    </p>


    <p>Finally, I wanted to look at another measure of happiness/quality of life, which is the Wellbeing index. Furthermore,
      instead of looking only at completion rates for education, I wanted to see whether the quality of education is important.
    </p>

     <!-- //////// CHART 8 //////// -->
     <div class="container">

    </div>
 

<p> This final graph proves the positive effect that not only the quantity of education has on peoples' lifestyle, but also the quality
  of it. As time gos on, the relationship only strengthens, where if quality  increases, welllbeing tends to follow suit.
